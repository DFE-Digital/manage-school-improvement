      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts </li>
         <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
         <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
         <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
         <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) </li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this website is</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Task statuses are not read out by some screen readers. This means that some people using screen readers may miss some important information that other users can get through visual association.</li>
        <li>Only the task links on the task list are selectable, rather than the whole row. This can make it harder for some users to open a task.</li>
        <li>Main headings on some pages are contained within groups of elements. This means they may not be read out correctly by some screen readers.</li>
      </ol>

            Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
        </h4>

            <li>information and relationships that are implied by visual formatting may not be read out correctly by some screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) </li>
